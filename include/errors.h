  //! This method will also return false if the object is in a "valid
  //! but unspecified state", for example after a move assignment or
  //! move construction.  This is so that the user doesn't have to
  //! call it twice.  It should ALWAYS return false if the object
  //! can't be used or the last operation had an error.

  //!
  //! If this library has been compiled with NO_EXCEPTIONS defined,
  //! this must be called after every function that can throw an
  //! error.

  //! \return true if the last method call was successful AND the

  //! If the object is not valid(), this method will get the last error
  //! that occurred.
  //!
  //! If the error caused the object to be put into a "valid but
  //! uncertain state" then this method will return the error that
  //! caused that, NOT UnspecifiedStateError.  If the operation that
  //! caused the "valid but unspecified state" was just a move
  //! assignment or move constructor, then it should return
  //! UnspecifiedStateError.
  //!
  //! This is a little confusing because getting put into a "valid
  //! but unspecified state" is not necessarily an error.  But for
  //! the valid() call and any subsequent call, it is an error, but
  //! the object was attempted to be used in a "valid but
  //! unspecified state".

  //! \return the last error that occurred during a method call.

  //! Only if all the following conditions are met:
  //! 1. The error state changed
  //! 2. An error handler is registered
  //! 3. The error is an actual error, and not std::nullopt
  //!
  //! This means it doesn't get called on things like resetting the
  //! error, setting an error that was already set, or when there is no
  //! error handler.
  //!
  //! There is no information about what function caused the error.
  //!
  //! \return 0 on success, nonzero on an error registering the
  //!         error handler
